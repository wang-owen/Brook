Brook is a web app which allows users to download and save YouTube and Spotify tracks and entire playlists.
* Users may create accounts and save playlists
* Playlists are automatically added to *Saved Playlists* when downloaded as long as user is logged in
* Saved playlists track any changes made to the playlist (e.g. added/removed tracks, name change, thumbnail change etc.)
* When saved playlists are "updated", a zip file containing any new tracks are downloaded.

**This is meant for those who do not wish to pay for a music streaming subscription, and want an easy way to download their online playlists onto their phones.**

## ü™≤ Known issues
- [ ] Downloads that take over 30 seconds initiate a Heroku timeout (not an issue when running locally)

## üìù To-do
- [ ] Add a download ETA to toast
- [ ] Implement "Public playlists" page, where users can opt to share their saved playlists publically
- [ ] Save database space by reusing playlist/track models when possible (i.e. playlists/tracks with same ID mapped to multiple users)
- [ ] Integrate Apple Music and Amazon Music
- [ ] Enable playlist conversion between platforms
- [ ] Desktop app that automatically manages file transfers?
