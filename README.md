# Brook

Brook offers a variety of tools regarding music streaming services.
* Download tracks and entire playlists from popular streaming services
* Saved playlists track any changes made to the playlist (e.g. added/removed tracks, name change, thumbnail change etc.)
* When saved playlists are "updated", a zip file containing any new tracks are downloaded.
* Convert (transfer) your playlists between music streaming services

## ü™≤ Known issues
- [ ] After authenticating with YouTube/Spotify, refresh needed for conversion to work (only occurs on cloud hosted app)
- [ ] Invalid link error when using shared YouTube link (YouTube updated share link, doesn't include "watch" keyword)
- [x] **[FIXED]** Saved playlists will be duplicated if downloaded from main form
- [x] **[FIXED]** Spotify bug where some songs are not downloaded and/or saved to duplicate file names
- [x] **[FIXED]** CloudAMQP instance downloads files successfully, but files cannot be found on Heroku filesystem, resulting in Server Error 500 when attempting to fetch
- [x] **[FIXED]** Downloads that take over 30 seconds initiate a Heroku timeout (not an issue when running locally)

## üìù To-do
- [ ] Integrate Apple Music
- [ ] Integrate Amazon Music
- [ ] Refactor database so tracks have a many-to-many relationship with playlists instead of Foreign Key (saves database space)
- [ ] Add a download ETA to toast
- [ ] Disable queueing more downloads as one is occurring
- [ ] Implement "Public playlists" page, where users can opt to share their saved playlists publically
